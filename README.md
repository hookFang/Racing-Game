# Georgian Racing Game Unreal Engine

Georgian Racing game was a final year project where we made use of Unreal engine
to create the game.
The Game has two game modes where one is to collect coins, and the other one is a timer match.
The current version of game only supports a single car, moving forward we are planning to add more cars
into the game, so that the player can change the car.
